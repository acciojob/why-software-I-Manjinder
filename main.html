		<h1>Why I Want to become a developer?</h1>
	    <p>I'm 20 and I've been a student for most years of my life.Over the past couple of years I've realised that I enjoy practical learning more also i want to bring out my creativity.The reasons for me to become a developer are that 
			It is the opportnity to learn new things everyday.
			I get to use my creative vision and imagination.
			I enjoy travelling and in my journey as a  dev i might get chances to travel new destinations.(that was kinda poetic(maybe))
			Lastly, developers get a good salary adding to that i can start freelancing anytime too. 
			Also, I might start E-commerce after knowing the inside outs of the tech.
			So yeah this is preety much it for now.
